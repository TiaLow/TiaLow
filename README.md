:speech_balloon: **Ask me about:** how JavaScript exemplifies the combination of logic and creativity, flexbox vs grid, how to choose a whiteboard app (by arrow-drawing abilities), binary trees, fermentation, gardening, living out of a backpack, how the natural and technological worlds can be woven together...
