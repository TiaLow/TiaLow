## Hi folks, I'm Tia! :v:
*Pronouns: she / her*
***

:pencil2: **I’m currently working on:** refactoring past projects and wireframing new ones, including the conversion of a command-line multiplater trivia game to a React Native mobile app.
<br>
<br>
:books: **I’m fired up about:** contributing to open source and TDD!
<br>
<br>
:speech_balloon: **Ask me about:** how JavaScript exemplifies the combination of logic and creativity, flexbox vs grid, how to choose a whiteboard app (by arrow-drawing abilities), binary trees, how fermentation is also found at the intersection of logic and creativity, gardening, living out of a backpack, how the natural and technological worlds can be woven together...
